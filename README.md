## File Integrity & Hash Verification Lab

**Tools Used**: Windows 11, Powershell, Get-FileHash, MD5, SHA1, SHA256

### Summary 
This lab deminstrates how to compute and verify file hashes using PowerShell. The objective was to understand the importance of crytographic hash functions in maintaining file integrity and preventing unauthorized modification. 

### Key Steps
- Used `Get-FileHash` to compute MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes.
- Compared hashes to validate file authenticity.
- Analyzed the differences in strength and reliability between various hashing algorithms.

### Outcome
Built foundation knowledgy in file integrity verification and recognized the risks associated with using outdated hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA1
